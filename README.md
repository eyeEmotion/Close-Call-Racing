# Close-Call-Racing
WIP arcade racer (also VR functionality in the future)

Learning as I go. I'm a Graphics Designer with a college-background in programming (for databases and web). First real attempt at game-development.

Inspiration for the game comes from the game Split Second: Velocity.
Will start of with 1 car and 1 track and expanding upon if all goes well.
